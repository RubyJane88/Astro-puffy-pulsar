Code Run Through and Examples

Automatic Integration Setup
Section titled Automatic Integration Setup
Astro includes an astro add command to automate the setup of integrations.

Run the astro add command using the package manager of your choice and our automatic integration wizard will update your configuration file and install any necessary dependencies.

Using Integrations
Section titled Using Integrations
Astro integrations are always added through the integrations property in your astro.config.mjs file.

There are three common ways to import an integration into your Astro project:

Installing an npm package integration.
Import your own integration from a local file inside your project.
Write your integration inline, directly in your config file.
